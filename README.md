# Quantitative Momentum Investing Strategy Project using Python

Momentum investing" means investing in the stocks that have increased in price the most.

In this project, I have built an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the highest price momentum. From there, I calculated recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks.
